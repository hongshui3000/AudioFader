AudioFader can be used to fade the volume in when starting playback or to fade the volume out when pausing or stopping playback.

This is an incomplete program. I put it on github only for copying the code to the computer in my office, where usb ports are blocked. And it is my freedom to choose a license for the programs written in my spare time.
